# Seam Carving
This program allows you to resize your image using seam carving technique. Original paper can be read 
[here](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/courses/15-463/2007_fall/hw/proj2/imret.pdf).

Also GUI interface is available. You can run gui.py and import your own images and specify masks for them.

P.S. GUI uses PyQt4, so you need to install it:
  * <b>For Mac</b>: 
    * Install [brew](https://brew.sh)
    * Write in terminal `brew install cartr/qt4/pyqt --with-python3`
  * <b>For Linux</b>:
    * Write in terminal `sudo apt-get install python-qt4`
  * <b>For Windows</b>:
    * Download PyQT4 binary from [here](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyqt4)
    * Write in command line `pip3 install (binary_file_name)/name_of_binary.whl`
